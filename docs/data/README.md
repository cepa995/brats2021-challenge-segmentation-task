## Dataset Description

This dataset includes brain MRI scans of adult brain glioma patients, comprising of 4 structural modalities (i.e., T1, T1c, T2, T2-FLAIR) and associated manually generated ground truth labels for each tumor sub-region (enhancement, necrosis, edema), as well as their MGMT promoter methylation status. These scans are a collection of data from existing TCIA collections, but also cases provided by individual institutions and willing to share with a cc-by license.

## Known Issues

TCIA dataset:
- DICOM files are available for only 560 participants
- NIfTI files are available for ALL ~1250 participants
- Some participants do not possess all 4x image modalities
- NIfTI files are corrupted, specifically, in a NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) file, srow_x, srow_y, and srow_z are part of the affine transformation matrix, which defines the relationship between voxel coordinates (index-based) and real-world coordinates (scanner space).This means that the sform matrix (which describes the spatial orientation of the image) is effectively undefined or meaningless. Possible Causes:
    - Corrupt or improperly converted NIfTI file:
        -If the software generating the NIfTI file didn't properly set spatial information, it might default to zeros.
    - The image has no meaningful spatial orientation:
        - If the file was created from raw data without proper spatial metadata.
    - Conversion issues (DICOM â†’ NIfTI):
        - Some DICOM to NIfTI conversion tools may fail to propagate the correct transformation matrix.
        - Some conversion tools require extra flags to preserve spatial information.
    - The file lacks real-world coordinate information:
        - Some NIfTI files only store voxel indices rather than real-world positioning.
